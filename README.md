## Synopsis
Plant height is a key trait studied in breeding and research programs. Measurements in the field are time-consuming as they require manual measurements with several replicates.  The UPHS is a phenotyping device that provides a significant improvement in sampling time and sample size. It uses low-cost ultrasonic sensors to screen the field canopy and obtain an accurate biological sample of this trait.

## Software
TBA

## Hardware
The UHPS will use an Arduino microcontroller and ultrasonic sensors to acquire plant height data. The ultrasonic sensor will emit a sound wave that will bounce back from the canopy. An initial read or manual input can be used as baseline (sensor height from the ground). This will be possible using a screen and at least three buttons. Once height zero is stored, we can calculate height from each data point and average a value from hundreds of data points collected in just a few seconds.
